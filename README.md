# webmaps
The webmaps in this repo are projects attempted by me. I started with the **population webmap** which shows the location of the volcanoes in USA followed by another layer showing the population census. Next I tried making another webmap that will show the rate of **covid infection(covid webmap)** in diffrent countries but kept on running into errors with the dataset i downloaded, so i put this on hold and moved to try yet another webmap. The **health site webmap** was a success in the sense that the primary aim of it displaying various health sites in Nigeria was accomplished. I plan to later take it further by
- making an interface which health centers can use to type in their details and have their place displayed on the map. 
- creating a search box that will check for the nearest health center to a person
- turning it into an app
